Building a Recipe Management REST API

Your task is to design and implement a RESTful API for managing a recipe database. The API should support the following functionalities:

CRUD Operations on Recipes:

Create a new recipe entry.
Retrieve details of a specific recipe.
Update information of an existing recipe.
Delete a recipe.
Listing Recipes:

Retrieve a list of all recipes.
Filter recipes based on cuisine, meal type, ingredients, or any other relevant criteria.
Recipe Ratings and Reviews:

Allow users to rate and add reviews/comments for recipes.
Retrieve reviews for a specific recipe

Design the endpoints for the above operations using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place (e.g., only authenticated users can add reviews).

Use meaningful HTTP status codes for different scenarios.
Design the API to be RESTful, following best practices for resource naming and URL structure.
Consider the data format for request and response payloads (e.g., JSON).
Additional Tasks 


Add search functionality for recipes based on different criteria (e.g., title, ingredients).
Include error handling mechanisms and provide informative error messages.
Instructions:

Design the API endpoints with their corresponding HTTP methods and URL paths.
